# Battleship

An app created as part of an Odin Project assignment. The app follows the rules of battleship. Each player takes a turn clicking a square, if there is a ship in that position, a hit is registered. When you sink all the ships of the opponent you win. The current version of this app works with a computer which randomly guesses locations on the board. 

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in the `dist/` folder and start playing! The board on the right is the computers board, the one which you click to provide guesses and the board on the left is yours where the computer will guess.
